# nimbus_devops

nimbus_devops is the third and final repo in the byte_of_py trilogy, focused on mastering modern cloud-based software engineering, writing Python-powered data pipelines, practicing CI/CD and Agile principles, and integrating cloud services (including Google Cloud, AWS, and MS Azure), plus a little side of Docker containerization

## 01 - The README - What's all this then?

This is a repo where I have committed to practicing Python while integrating with SQL databases using environments and resources in the cloud. Many of the directories are self-explanatory, though there is more info table of contents below.

To spin up the environment a .env file with the name of your virtual environment and the path to activate it. Then simply run:

`source ./nimbus_devops.sh start`
OR
`. ./nimbus_devops.sh start`

To shut down, run the same command withour the `start` parameter.

## 02 - Containerization

Docker containerization of a flask and two django apps (workshop1 connects to a Postgres database)

## 03 - AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Deployed containerized app to EC2 instance via ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry)
Technologies: AWS Lambda, EC2, Relational Database Service (RDS), Elastic Container Registry (ECR),
AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)

## 04 CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment

## 05 Pytest & Unittest

## 06 Google Cloud Platform
